# App Design Resources

Open source (free) materials that you can use to make your app look nice. Don't pixel push. Get something that looks good enough, then move on. Many nice-looking apps have died a silent death before ever touching a user's hands.

## Design tips for the design-challenged (that's you)

Many people think they have an eye for design. And that's the problem right there. Design is not about your eyes.

_**[Design is how it works](https://quotesondesign.com/steve-jobs/#:~:text=Most%20people%20make%20the%20mistake,what%20we%20think%20design%20is.&text=Design%20is%20how%20it%20works.)** — Steve Jobs_

Your job is to make something work—simply, explicitly, and transparently—for your users.

So follow these rules at first. Make it work. Add your accents and flourishes later.

#### Never center

Don't center align anything in your application. By default, left align everything. Use Bootstrap columns to layout your app. Right float buttons that need the users' attention.

#### White background

You can have a full page image on your landing page. But your app should have a white background. That's the industry standard and that will help with color contrast.

#### A single, clear, professional font

It's not time to get cute. It's time to look like a real app.

#### One color

All the text should be black or dark gray and on a white background. Use **one color**, your primary color, for buttons, links, and other UI. You can add more later, but make a functioning app with only one color to start.

Later, you may use a red color for error messages.

#### Resist the urge to put everything in a box

Instead, use space and proximity (C.R.A.P.) to make things appear together or separate. You may use a thin gray line to separate list items if you must—better than making "cards" or boxes for every item.

#### Use real-looking data

If you are displaying the description of a Vitamix blender, use real-looking data like this:

> With intuititive, versatile controls, exhilirating power, and durability backed up by a 5-year warranty, the new Explorian® Series E310 will forever change the way you cook, it's never been easier to become a Vitamix owner.

## Logos

When picking or making a logo, use one that looks good at small sizes (like a width of 24px). So avoid overly complicated logos.
